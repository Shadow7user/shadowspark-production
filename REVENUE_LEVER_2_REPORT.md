# Revenue Lever #2: Smart Pricing Page Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a high-conversion **Pricing Page** (`src/app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx`) designed to monetize the new Certificate System.

## Key Features

### 1. Value-Based Tiering

- **Starter (Free)**: Anchors the price, offering basic access but explicitly excluding certificates.
- **Pro Student (₦15k/mo)**: The "Hero" tier. Highlights **"Verifiable Certificates (LinkedIn Ready)"** as the primary upsell.
- **Lifetime Access (₦150k)**: High-ticket option for professionals, offering unlimited value.

### 2. Psychological Triggers

- **Social Proof**: "Verified by ShadowSpark" visual cues.
- **Scarcity/Urgency**: "Most Popular" badging on the Pro tier.
- **Visuals**: Cyberpunk aesthetic aligns with the tech/future brand identity.

### 3. Integration

- Added to **Main Navigation** and **Footer**.
- Links directly to `/register` with plan intent parsing (ready for future billing logic).
