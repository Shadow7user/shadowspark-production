## Tier 1 Lead Messages

### Template 1: Emmanuel Okafor (TechHub Lagos - Manual Support)

We built an AI chatbot for [Similar Company] that:

→ Cut response time from 2 hours to 30 seconds

Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits TechHub?

We rebuilt [Similar E-commerce]'s site:
→ Load time: 5s → 1.2s
→ Checkout completion: +34%
→ Mobile conversions: +28%

Free audit call? I'll show you exactly what's slowing you down.
