# Revenue & Growth Projection Model
## Progress Tracking System Impact Analysis

**Project:** ShadowSpark Academy - Lesson Completion & Certificate Tracking
**Timeline:** Jan 27 - Feb 24, 2026 (4 weeks)
**Status:** Ready for Week 1 Deployment

---

## Baseline Metrics (Current State)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Enrollments/Month** | 1-2 | Limited growth without tracking |
| **Course Completion Rate** | ~15% | Industry baseline without progress UI |
| **Avg Lessons per Student** | 2-3 / 10 | High dropout after module 1 |
| **Student Retention (Week 1→4)** | ~50% | Standard LMS dropout curve |
| **Revenue/Month** | $15-30K | 1-2 × $15K course price |
| **Referral Conversion** | Low (~1%) | Limited success stories / proof |
| **Certificate Issuance** | 0 | N/A - not yet offered |

**Problem:** No visibility into learning progress → students feel lost → high dropout

## Breakthrough Moment: Week 3 (Certificates)

**Why Week 3 is the Inflection Point:**

1. **Psychological Shift:**
   - Before: "I completed a course" (low confidence)
   - After: "I earned a certificate" (shareable proof)
   - → 53% completion lift (TagMango data, similar market)

2. **Social Proof Unlocked:**
   - Students download cert → share on LinkedIn → visible proof
   - Network sees "just completed AI Prompting course" → viral loop
   - Expected viral coefficient: 0.3 (30% of completers refer 1+ friends)

3. **Revenue Diversification:**
   - Shift from "course sales only" → course + cert + premium cert
   - Premium cert ($25) targets high-intent learners
   - Path to advanced credentials ($100+) in Year 2

4. **Data Collection:**
   - Certificates enable credential verification
   - Enables job board / hiring integration
   - Future marketplace for employers to find graduates
